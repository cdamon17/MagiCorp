I set out to make a game magic game, but after looking over what I have done, I feel that I could have done more to show magic with in the world, like maybe I could have given the player some useless, or even useful spells they could use, but that did not occur to me until it was to late to try to program it in.

One time where I got stuck was when I was trying to make a door that the player could not interact with until certain conditions are met. I was helped by Johnothan Nakagawa with this problem when he showed me how I could use variables to make the door work.

My puzzles included a spin dial locked door that you have to talk with an NPC to find the code. I also have a combination puzzle where you have to find the pieces of an item and combine them to make something new. My third puzzle was the player had to learn a spell and say magic words to find a secret door.

I feel the game play it self seems a bit lacking and that given more time I might have been able to make it more interactive, but I think that some of the story within the game can make up for that for the user’s experience to be enjoyable.

Brent Uramoto beta tested my game. By playing through my game he helped me find parts that I forgot to program completely of finish dialog. He also gave me a few ideas as to how to improve the game. I inturn tested Brent’s game for him, and was able to help him find parts of his story that were confusing or needed to be more clear.

I think that I am most proud of coding the magic words puzzle and making the secrete door.

Next time I think I would try to add more to the game in a way so it would be less straight forward.
