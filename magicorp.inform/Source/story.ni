Rule for deciding whether all includes something: it does not.
[Code for snide remark after take all from A Day for Spelling by Mary Kiang]
Rule for printing a parser error when the latest parser error is the nothing to do error: say "That would make things to easy, try to have some fun :)" instead.

[code needed to change what is said for take all
if player takes all, say "That would make things to easy."]

When play begins: say "This is an exiting day! You have been invited by the board to sit in on a conference about the company's newest product for techno magic. As you open the door, your face contorts in horror to find all the Conference Room littered with the unmoving bodies of the board members, killed by magic, and one shivering witness in the corner. This is a tragedy, the company will be thrown into ruin from this loss unless the true murderer can be caught. It is up to you to find the culprit and save Magicorp."

The description of the player is "Your wearing your nicest suit for the conference. Magician robes did not seem necessary today."


Conference Room is a room. "The room ment to be your next step in the Magicorp ladder, now strewn with the bodies of the dead board members with only one living witness in the corner. You will need to find out exactly what happened. Maybe ask the witness about the murders? The Meeting room is to the east and Offices to the north."

bodies is a thing. bodies is in Conference Room. bodies is scenery. the description is "The board members seem to have been... disposed of, in different and unnatural ways, some too gruesome to describe. This can only be the work of a corporate magician to undermine the company. The sight is repulsive, but you are determined to find the one who did this. You could ask the witness about the murders."

Offices is a room. Offices is north of Conference Room. "This room is the offices for the basic workers, filled with closed work stations. it seems like all are oblivious to what happened in the conference room. It would not help to talk to these guys, so just focus on finding the culprit. The Conference Room is to the south, the Guard's Office is to the east, and the Hallway is to the west."

work stations is a container. work stations is closed and openable. work stations is fixed in place. work stations is in Offices. drawers is undescribed. the description is "A place where people work, they are closed right now but could be opened if your looking for something."

Security Room is a room. Security Room is east of Security Door. "This room holds security for the entire building. The Imagecaster would have seen what happened, but it seems to be missing! The dust around where it should be suggests that it was broken apart though, the murderer must have done this to cover his tracks! You will need to find the missing peaces and combine them back into an Imagecaster so you can see how the murderer escaped. The Meeting room is to the west."

[spin dial locked door from Laboratory Escape by Cole Damon]
Security Door is a door. Security Door is east of Meeting Room. Security Door is fixed in place, locked and lockable, closed and openable. the description is "A locked door protecting the Security room. It seems to be locked with a charmed spin dial so magic can not unlock it. The only way to get inside is to SPIN TO a 4 digit code all at once. The guard in the Guard's Office might know what it is."
Understand "dial" and "dials" as the door.

Instead of opening Security Door when Security Door is locked:
    say "The door is sealed shut and seems like opens only when the correct combination is spun in the spin dial at once. You must SPIN THE DIAL TO the correct 4 digit code."
    
[Create an action for spinning the dials.]
Understand "spin [something] to [a number]" as spinning it to.
spinning it to is an action applying to one thing and one number. 

[Check the action spinning in case its not applied to Genetics door.]
Check spinning it to:
	if the noun is not Security Door:
		say "[The noun] does not spin." instead. 

[If not Genetics door, give this feedback.]
Report spinning it to:
    say "Click, and not much else happens."

[If they spin the correct code, then Genetics door is unlocked.]
Instead of spinning the closed Security Door to 2657:
    now Security Door is unlocked;
    say "The door unlocks and glides open".
[End of code to open locked Genetics door.]

	add the noun to X;
	add the second noun to X;
	sort X; 
	repeat through the Table of Imagecaster Parts: 
		let Y be the parts list entry; 
		sort Y; 
		if X is Y: 
			now the Contraption is the results entry.

[if there is no match for the combination of things, there is no result for the combining, so STOP the action]
Check combining it with:
	if Contraption is nothing:
		say "You can't combine [the noun] and [the second noun] into anything useful.[line break]Try another combination of things.";
		stop the action.

[If action is not stopped, continue toâ€¦]
Carry out combining it with: 
	say "You fuse together [the noun] and [the second noun].";

[conditions of casting]
Instead of casting portasum openab:
	if the player does not have Spell Note, say "The words were said correctly, but it seems that they also need the source material of the spell to channel magic through while ."instead;
	if the player has Spell Note: 
		say "In a clap of thunder and a bright flash, a glowing portal appears to the north.";

Instead of doing anything to Void Portal: [This code tells player that he cannot go through the door]
	If VoidPortal is 0:

Understand "murder", "deaths", and "death" as "[murders]".

Understand "company", "job", "jobs", and "work" as "[Magicorp]".

guard is a man. guard is in Guard's Office. the description is "He is a stern looking man in the blue guard uniform and sunglasses. He is in charge of the security on this level. He would know the spin dial code to the Security room, you could ask him about it."

Wait, what? Dead? All of them? Ofcourse I'll help you, we need to find this murder fast! The code is this year, so just spin the dial to 2657.".
Understand "security door", and "door" as "[code]".

[nstead of asking Jennifer about "[dinner]":

'I think I still have that recipe in my recipe drawer.' [paragraph break] 'Ok, cool' responds Jennifer. I still have a lot of work to do, so could you call me back when you have it ready?'

            say "[The noun] has already told you that [summary entry]."; 
        otherwise: 
            now turn stamp entry is the turn count; 
            say "[reply entry][paragraph break]"; 
    otherwise:
