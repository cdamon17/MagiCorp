This is an exciting day! You have been invited by the board to sit in on a conference about the company&apos;s newest product for techno magic. As you open the door, your face contorts in horror to find the Conference Room littered with the unmoving bodies of the board members, killed by magic, and one shivering witness in the corner. This is a tragedy, the company will be thrown into ruin from this loss unless the true murderer can be caught. It is up to you to find the culprit and save Magicorp.

Magicorp
A murder in Magicorp by Cole Damon The story creation year is 2014
Release 1 / Serial number 141103 / Inform 7 build 6L38 (I6/v6.33 lib 6/12N) SD

Conference Room
The room, meant to be your next step in the Magicorp ladder, is now strewn with the bodies of the dead board members with only one living witness in the corner. You will need to find out exactly what happened. Maybe ask the witness about the murders? The Meeting room is to the east and Offices to the north.

You can see witness here.

Security Room
This room holds security for the entire building. The Imagecaster would have seen what happened, but it seems to be missing! The dust around where it should be suggests that it was broken apart though, the murderer must have done this to cover his tracks! You will need to find the missing peaces and combine them back into an Imagecaster so you can see how the murderer escaped. The Meeting room is to the west.

Security Room
This room holds security for the entire building. The Imagecaster would have seen what happened, but it seems to be missing! The dust around where it should be suggests that it was broken apart though, the murderer must have done this to cover his tracks! You will need to find the missing peaces and combine them back into an Imagecaster so you can see how the murderer escaped. The Meeting room is to the west.

Dark Arts Inc is Magicorp&apos;s biggest rival, of course they would send some one to sabotage you.



    *** The portal sucks you in but on the other side, oh, no. This is Dark Arts Inc, Magicorp&apos;s biggest rival in techno magic innovation! You are met with magicians pointing wands at you, and one with a black hood on. Its a trap! The murderer knew you were following him and was expecting you to come through. The portal has closed behind you and theres no escape. It seems all is lost for Magicorp now :( ***
