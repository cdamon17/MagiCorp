This is an exiting day! You have been invited by the board to sit in on a conference about the company&apos;s newest product for techno magic. As you open the door, your face contorts in horror to find all the Conference Room littered with the unmoving bodies of the board members, killed by magic, and one shivering witness in the corner. This is a tragedy, the company will be thrown into ruin from this loss unless the true murderer can be caught. It is up to you to find the culprit and save Magicorp.

Magicorp
A murder in Magicorp by Cole Damon The story creation year is 2014
Release 1 / Serial number 141026 / Inform 7 build 6L38 (I6/v6.33 lib 6/12N) SD

Conference Room
The room ment to be your next step in the Magicorp ladder, now strewn with the bodies of the dead board members with only one living witness in the corner. You will need to find out exactly what happened. Maybe ask the witness about the murders? The Meeting room is to the east and Offices to the north.

You can see witness here.
